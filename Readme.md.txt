# Task 1 – Variables

## Objective
To understand basic variable usage in Python, data types, keywords, and simple arithmetic operations.

## Tasks Performed
1. Stored the value of π using the expression 22/7 and identified its data type.
2. Attempted to use a reserved keyword (`for`) as a variable name and understood Cannot use 'for' as a variable name because it is a reserved keyword in Python.
3. Calculated Simple Interest using the formula:
   Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## Tools Used
- Python (Anaconda)
- VS Code

## Conclusion
This task helped reinforce Python basics such as variable declaration, data types, and arithmetic operations.
