# Web Scraper – Intermediate Task

## Objective
To extract data from a website using Python by sending HTTP requests
and parsing HTML content using BeautifulSoup.

## Description
This project demonstrates a basic web scraping technique by extracting
quotes from a sample website designed for scraping practice
(http://quotes.toscrape.com).

The program:
- Sends a request to the website
- Checks if the page loads successfully
- Parses the HTML content
- Extracts quotes from specific HTML tags
- Displays the extracted data in readable form

## Technologies Used
- Python
- requests library
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- VS Code
- Anaconda

## How It Works
1. The program sends an HTTP GET request to the target website.
2. The response status code is checked to ensure successful loading.
3. HTML content is parsed using BeautifulSoup.
4. Quotes are located using tag and class selectors.
5. Extracted quotes are printed to the console.

## Conclusion
This task helped in understanding how web scraping works, how websites
structure data using HTML, and how Python can be used to automate
data extraction.
